# Sentiment_Analysis_with_LSTM
Build an accurate and  robust model that can classify the sentiment of a given review as positive, negative or neutral.


To build a robust and accurate model that can classify the sentiment of a given review as positive, negative, or neutral. The model needs to be trained on a large dataset of Amazon food product reviews, which can be lengthy and contain multiple sentences, and generalize well to unseen reviews. The goal is to develop a scalable and efficient approach to sentiment analysis that can provide valuable insights into customer preferences and opinions, which can in turn inform business decisions and marketing strategies. The main challenges include handling the variability and complexity of natural language, dealing with imbalanced class distribution, and selecting appropriate hyperparameters for the LSTM network. The solution to this problem can have significant implications for the e-commerce industry, by providing a powerful tool for analyzing customer feedback and improving product offerings.
